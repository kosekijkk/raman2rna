# Raman2RNA: Live-cell label-free prediction of single-cell RNA expression profiles by Raman microscopy

Raman2RNA code base.

Raman2RNA (R2R) is a new experimental and computational framework that allows for the prediction of single-cell RNA profiles in live cells without the need for labels or invasive experiments. R2R is based on domain translation ML methods, which allows one to translate Raman spectra, a label-free hyperspectral imaging modality, to scRNA-seq profiles.
